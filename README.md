# CF Networking Release

This repository is a [BOSH](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh) release for
deploying CF Networking and associated tasks. CF Networking provides
policy-based container networking and service discovery for Cloud Foundry.

For information on getting started with Cloud Foundry look at the docs for
[CF Deployment](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-deployment).

### <a name="running-tests"></a>Running Tests

##### With Docker

Running tests for this release requires a `DB` flavor. The following scripts with default to `mysql` DB. Set `DB` environment variable for alternate DBs e.g. <mysql-8.0(or mysql),mysql-5.7,postgres>

- `./scripts/create-docker-container.bash`: This will create a docker container with appropriate mounts.
- `./scripts/test-in-docker-locally.bash`: Create docker container and run all tests and setup in a single script.
  - `./scripts/test-in-docker-locally.bash <package> <sub-package>`: For running tests under a specific package and/or sub-package: e.g. `./scripts/test-in-docker-locally.bash policy-server api`

When inside docker container: 
- `/repo/scripts/docker/test.bash`: This will run all tests in this release
- `/repo/scripts/docker/test.bash policy-server`: This will only run `policy-server` tests
- `/repo/scripts/docker/test.bash policy-server api`: This will only run `policy-server` sub-package tests for `api` package
- `/repo/scripts/docker/tests-templates.bash`: This will run all of tests for bosh tempalates
- `/repo/scripts/docker/lint.bash`: This will run all of linting defined for this repo.

## <a name="cni-plugin-dev-resources"></a>CF CNI Plugin Developer Resources

- [3rd Party Plugin Development](docs/3rd-party.md) describes how to create a CNI plugin for CF that would replace silk-release.
