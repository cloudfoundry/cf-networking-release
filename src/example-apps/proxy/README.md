# proxy

The `proxy` app was initially designed to enable testing inter-application connectivity on
using Cloud Foundry's container networking features:

Push two differently named instances of the app
```bash
cd ~/workspace/cf-networking-release/src/example-apps/proxy
cf push appA
cf push appB
```

See that they are reachable and what their IPs are
```bash
curl appa.<system-domain>
curl appb.<system-domain>
```

See that proxying from A to B works using its public route
```bash
curl appa.<system-domain>/proxy/appb.<system-domain>
```

See that proxying from A to B works using its overlay IP address with after adding a network policy
```bash
cf add-network-policy appA appB
curl appa.<system-domain>/proxy/<overlay-ip-of-appB>:8080
```

See that proxying from A to B works using an internal route with after adding a network policy
```bash
cf map-route appB apps.internal --hostname appB
curl appa.<system-domain>/proxy/appB.apps.internal:8080
```

It has since grown to include some additional endpoints useful for testing
networking features.

# Endpoints

## `/`

[Info handler](./handlers/info_handler.go) returns the overly IP address and
ports that the application container is listening on.

Example:
```bash
$ curl https://proxy.mydomain.com/
{"ListenAddresses":["127.0.0.1","10.255.208.82"],"Port":8080}
```

## `/dig/${domain}`

[Dig handler](./handlers/dig_handler.go) uses `net.LookupIP` to return the IP
addresses for the domain requested as a path variable to the endpoint

```bash
$ curl https://proxy.mydomain.com/dig/example.com
["93.184.216.34","\u003cnil\u003e"]
```

## `/digudp/${domain}`

[Dig UDP handler](./handlers/dig_udp_handler.go) shells out to `dig` with
`+notcp` to look up the IP addresses for the domain requested as a path variable
to the endpoint using UDP.

```bash
$ curl https://proxy.mydomain.com/dig/example.com
["93.184.216.34"]
```

## `/download/${numbytes}`

[Download handler](./handlers/download_handler.go) responds with a randomly
generated body of length in bytes equal to `numbytes`

```bash
$ curl https://proxy.mydomain.com/download/1024 > foo && wc -c foo
    1024 foo
```

## `/dumprequest/`

[Dump request handler](./handlers/dump_request_handler.go) dumps the request
headers received and responds with them in the response body.

```bash
$ curl https://proxy.mydomain.com/dumprequest -H "X-MyHeader: foo"
GET /dumprequest/ HTTP/1.1
Host: proxy.mydomain.com
Accept: */*

```

#### Optional param `returnHeaders`
The Dump requests handler also takes an optional boolean query param
`returnHeaders` that will, when `true`:
- clone the headers sent to the proxy and add them to
  the response headers
- return two additional debug headers: `X-Proxy-Settable-Debug-Header` and
  `X-Proxy-Immutable-Debug-Header`

The value returned by proxy in the `X-Proxy-Settable-Debug-Header` will be
copied from the original request's `X-Proxy-Settable-Debug-Header` header, if
present. As it's name implies, `X-Proxy-Immutable-Debug-Header` cannot be
configured and will *always* return the header with the same value.

```bash
$ curl -v -H 'X-Proxy-Settable-Debug-Header: potato' https://proxy.mydomain.com/dumprequest/?returnHeaders=true
...

```

## `/echosourceip`

[Echo source IP handler](./handlers/echo_source_ip_handler.go) responds with the
IP address of the client making the request. This can be useful when used in
combination with the `/proxy/` endpoint

```bash
$ curl https://proxy.mydomain.com/
{"ListenAddresses":["127.0.0.1","10.255.208.54"],"Port":8080}

$ curl https://proxy.mydomain.com/proxy/appB.apps.internal/echosourceip
10.255.208.54 # IP address of the proxy app making the request
```

## `/eventuallyfail`

[Eventually Fail handler](./handlers/eventually_fail.go) responds to the first
5 requests with a 200 status code. After the 5th request the endpoint responds
with a 500 status code. You can configure how many times the endpoint should
succeed before failing by setting the `EVENTUALLY_FAIL_AFTER_COUNT` env var.
This endpoint was created to test app healthchecks.

## `/eventuallysucceed`

[Eventually Succeed handler](./handlers/eventually_succeed.go) responds to the first
5 requests with a 500 status code. After the 5th request the endpoint responds
with a 200 status code. You can configure how many times the endpoint should
fail before succeeding by setting the `EVENTUALLY_SUCCEED_AFTER_COUNT` env var.
This endpoint was created to test app healthchecks.

## `/flap`

[Flap handler](./handlers/flap_handler.go) responds to the first 5 requests
with a 200 status code. It responds to the next 5 requests with a 500 status
code. It continues to flap back and forth between 200 and 500 status codes
every 5 requests. You can configure how often the endpoint should flap by
setting the `FLAP_INTERVAL` env var. This endpoint was created to test app
healthchecks.

## `/ping/${destination}`

[Ping handler](./handlers/ping_handler.go) shells out to `ping` to ping the
destination address and responds with success or failure.

```bash
$ curl https://proxy.mydomain.com/ping/example.com
Ping succeeded to destination: example.com

$ curl https://proxy.mydomain.com/ping/schmexample.com
Ping failed to destination: schmexample.com: exit status 2
```

## `/proxy/${destination}`

[Proxy handler](./handlers/proxy_handler.go) makes an HTTP request to
`${destination}` and returns the response. Useful for testing network
connectivity between applications:

```bash
$ cf add-network-policy appA appB
$ cf map-route appB apps.internal --hostname appB
$ curl https://appa.mydomain.com/proxy/appB.apps.internal:8080
{"ListenAddresses":["127.0.0.1","10.255.208.82"],"Port":8080}
```

## `/stats`

[Stats handler](./handlers/stats_handler.go) returns latency data for prior
requests to the `/proxy/` endpoint. Can be cleared with the `DELETE` method.

```bash
$ curl https://appa.mydomain.com/stats
{"latency":[]}

$ curl https://appa.mydomain.com/proxy/appB.apps.internal:8080
$ curl https://appa.mydomain.com/proxy/appB.apps.internal:8080
$ curl https://appa.mydomain.com/proxy/appB.apps.internal:8080
$ curl https://appa.mydomain.com/proxy/appB.apps.internal:8080

$ curl https://appa.mydomain.com/stats
{"latency":[0.006587316,0.007722343,0.005693,0.005313626]}

$ curl https://appa.mydomain.com/stats -X DELETE
$ curl https://appa.mydomain.com/stats
{"latency":[]}
```

## `/timed_dig/${domain}`

[Timed dig handler](./handlers/timed_dig_handler.go) like `/dig/`, but with
timing information in the response.

```bash
$ curl https://proxy.mydomain.com/dig/example.com
{"lookup_time_ms":2,"ips":["93.184.216.34","\u003cnil\u003e"]}
```

## `/upload`
[Upload handler](./handlers/upload_handler.go) returns the number of bytes
received in the request body.

```bash
$ curl https://proxy.mydomain.com/download/1024 > foo
$ curl https://proxy.mydomain.com/upload --data-binary @foo
1024 bytes received and read
```
