  max_open_connections:
    description: |
      Maximum number of open connections to the SQL database.

      The number of necessary connections will scale with the number of diego-cells in the deployment.
      The handlers that use the db conns in this job respond to the vxlan-policy-agent, which runs on the diego-cells.
      Each agent polls this server once every 5s, by default.
      Anecdote: in an environment with ~300 diego-cells has seen use up to ~200 conns.
      Anecdote: in an environment with ~200 diego-cells has seen use up to ~170 conns.
      In these scenarios, each instance of this job would expect total-number-of-conns/job-instance-count conns each.
      Idle state will likely use fewer connections.
    default: 200

  max_idle_connections:
    description: |
      Maximum number of idle connections to the SQL database

      Idle connections will be retained until their `connections_max_lifetime_seconds` has been reached.
    default: 200

  connections_max_lifetime_seconds:
    description: |
      Sets the maximum amount of time a connection may be reused. Expired connections may be closed lazily before reuse.
      If value <= 0, connections are reused forever

      If there is a spike in connection usage, all of these connections have the potential to stick around with a high lifetime.
      Lowering the lifetime will result in connections getting reaped sooner, but the policy server may have to renegotiate connections
      more often, which could add some latency. We recommend using the default unless you have seen specific needs to change it.
    default: 3600

  enforce_experimental_dynamic_egress_policies:
    description: "Set to true for dynamic egress policy enforcement.  Note that you can still create dynamic egress policies through the external API."
    default: false
