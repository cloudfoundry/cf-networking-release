  connections_max_lifetime_seconds:
    description: |
      Sets the maximum amount of time a connection may be reused. Expired connections may be closed lazily before reuse.
      If value <= 0, connections are reused forever

      If there is a spike in connection usage, all of these connections have the potential to stick around with a high lifetime.
      Lowering the lifetime will result in connections getting reaped sooner, but the policy server may have to renegotiate connections
      more often, which could add some latency. We recommend using the default unless you have seen specific needs to change it.
