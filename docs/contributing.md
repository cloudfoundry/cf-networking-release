## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community.  Here are guidelines for
development.

1. **Create an issue**
  
    I can hear you already: "What? I'm trying to do the right thing and create a PR! Why would I make an issue?"
    If you create an issue we can help point you in the right direction  or warn you about any gotchas. Just mention in
    the issue that you are planning on writing a PR to fix the issue. 

2. **Make your changes**

    Make sure to add tests and docs changes here too!

3. **Run tests**
   
   This includes unit, template, integration, and acceptance tests. See [Test Overview](test-overview.md) for how to run all of these tests.

4. **Submit a PR**

   There might be a little back and forth here, but hopefully it will be a quick and easy merge. Now you are a CF Networking Contributor. Congrats!
