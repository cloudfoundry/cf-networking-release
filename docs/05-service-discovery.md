# Service Discovery

## Architecture

### Architecture Diagram
![](service-discovery-arch.png)

Routes are emitted from the Route Emitter. Internal routes are emitted from the
Route Emitter as well, on a separate topic.

The NATS message queue cluster that handles routes for the gorouter also handles
internal routes.

The Service Discovery Controller (SDC) subscribes to route updates from NATS on
the internal routes topic. The SDC is highly available. The SDC has no
persistence, it is an in memory store of internal domain names to IPs. The SDC
warms (populates routes) before entering service.

Each Diego Cell has a BOSH DNS and a BOSH-DNS Adapter. App containers are
configured to use the BOSH DNS server on their Deigo cell as their DNS server.
The BOSH-DNS Adapter configures BOSH DNS to route queries for internal domains
to itself. When a request for an internal domain hits BOSH DNS it looks at the
domain name. If it's internal it directs the request to the BOSH-DNS Adapter.
BOSH DNS communicates to the BOSH DNS Adapter via http (following the [Google
DNS over
HTTPS](https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/dns-over-https)
schema).

The BOSH DNS adapter in turn makes a request to the SDC. This HTTP connection is
secured using mTLS. Responses from the SDC contain all the IPs of all the app
containers associated with the requested route. Responses from the BOSH DNS
adapter contain all the IPs returned from the SDC, shuffled. BOSH DNS in turn
returns the full set of IPs originally from the SDC. Clients typically use the
first IP in the DNS response, the shuffling provides a crude form of load
balancing.

## Metrics

Below are a list of metrics for service discovery components. To deploy a firehose nozzle to see the metrics, upload the
[datadog-firehose-nozzle-release](http://bosh.io/releases/github.com/DataDog/datadog-firehose-nozzle-release) and follow
the instructions [here](https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-firehose-nozzle-release) to deploy.

Metric Name | Description
------------ | -------------
`bosh_dns_adapter.GetIPsRequestTime` | duration of get ip request in milliseconds
`bosh_dns_adapter.GetIPsRequestCount` | number of get ip requests
`bosh_dns_adapter.DNSRequstFailures` | number of failed requests to the Service Discovery Controller
`bosh_dns_adapter.uptime` | process uptime, emitted on 10 second interval
`service_discovery_controller.RegistrationRequestTime` | duration of registration request in milliseconds
`service_discovery_controller.RegistrationRequestCount` | number of registration requests
`service_discovery_controller.addressTableLookupTime` | duration of looking up address table in milliseconds
`service_discovery_controller.uptime` | process uptime, emitted on 10 second interval
`service_discovery_controller.dnsRequest` | count of successful dnsRequests, emitted on a 10 second interval
`service_discovery_controller.registerMessagesReceived` | count of route register messages received via NATS from route emitter
`service_discovery_controller.maxRouteMessageTimePerInterval` | maximum time taken from BBS to SDC, only on new app creation


## CF App Service Discovery

### Motivation
Previously, Application Developers who wanted to use container to container
networking were required to bring their own service discovery. We had provided
examples with Eureka and Amalgam8, and received user feedback that usage of c2c
was very difficult. Common themes emerging:
* Polyglot microservices written in languages/frameworks other than Java/Spring
  cannot easily use Eureka
* Clustering applications have a requirement to address individual instances
* Additional VMs need to be deployed and managed to provide external service
  discovery

In order to support all types of apps, languages and frameworks, we built
service discovery for c2c into the platform. With this feature, users no longer
have to bring their own service discovery.

### App Developer Experience

You can run `map-route` with the internal domain to create and map an internal
route for your app.

### Interaction with Policy

By default, apps cannot talk to each other over cf networking. In order for an
app to talk to another app, you must still set a policy allowing access.

## Internal Domains

### Configuring Custom Internal Domains

Creating your own internal domain requires [enable-service-discovery
opsfile](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-deployment/blob/master/operations/enable-service-discovery.yml)
and the following two operations:
1. Add the custom internal domain name(s) to the `internal_domains` property on
   the `bosh-dns-adapter` job.

```yaml
- type: replace
  path: /instance_groups/name=diego-cell/jobs/name=bosh-dns-adapter/properties/internal_domains?
  value: ["apps.internal."]
```

> NOTE: The internal domain property in bosh-dns-adapter supports domains with
> and without the trailing dot.

2. Run the following command after deployment:

```bash
cf create-shared-domain <DOMAIN> --internal
```

Or, add the custom internal domain to the `apps_domains` property on
`cloud_controller_ng` job.

```yaml
- type: replace
  path: /instance_groups/name=api/jobs/name=cloud_controller_ng/properties/app_domains/-
  value:
    name: apps.internal
    internal: true
```

NOTE: The internal domain property in cloud_controller_ng does not accept
domains with a trailing dot.

3. Deploy.

To delete a shared domain, run one of the following commands:

```bash
cf curl -X DELETE /v2/shared_domains/<SHARED DOMAIN GUID>
```

```bash
cf delete-shared-domain <DOMAIN> [-f]
```

### Updating to cf-networking-release v2.11.0 or later

Before v2.11.0, the internal domain `apps.internal` was the default bosh
property for the `internal_domains` property on the `bosh-dns-adapter` job.
Starting in v2.11.0 this will no longer be the case. It will need to be set on
that property in order for `apps.internal` to continue working.

### Notes on CAPI Release

With capi-release versions 1.49.0-1.60.0:

- The internal domain `apps.internal` is automatically created for you.

With capi-release versions 1.61.0-1.63.0:

- The `apps.internal` internal domain is no longer seeded and must be created
  using the CAPI api. See the [Example steps](#example-steps) section for
  instructions.
- A custom domain name may be used when creating an internal domain name, but
  note that the bosh-dns-adapter job's `internal_domains` property must be
  updated too. The default value for this property is 'apps.internal'.

With capi-release versions >= 1.63.0:

- The `apps.internal` internal domain is included by default with the
  [enable-service-discovery
  opsfile](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-deployment/blob/master/operations/enable-service-discovery.yml).
- A custom domain name may be used and the `apps.internal` domain may be deleted
  using the API.



#### Example steps
***Assumes you're running a recent environment from cf-deployment***
* Pull down your current manifest with
```bash
bosh manifest > /tmp/cf-manifest.yml
```

* Create an internal domain.

> Note: this step is not neccessary if using the [enable-service-discovery
> opsfile](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-deployment/blob/master/operations/enable-service-discovery.yml)
> unless you wish to create a different internal shared domain.

```bash
cf curl /v2/shared_domains -d '{
  "name": "CUSTOM_INTERNAL_DOMAIN_NAME",
  "internal": true
}'
```

* Use the following command to list the domains, and to verify which of the
  domains are `'internal': true`

```bash
cf curl /v2/shared_domains
```

* Update the `internal_domains` job property on the `bosh-dns-adapter` job if
  the internal domain is not `apps.internal`. The list of domains should match
  the internal domains that have been configured in the prior step.  The
  `internal_domains` job property defaults to `['apps.internal']`.

* Update your deployment with the ops files

``` bash
bosh deploy /tmp/cf-manifest.yml \
  -o ~/workspace/cf-deployment/operations/use-bosh-dns-for-containers.yml \
  -o ~/workspace/cf-deployment/operations/use-bosh-dns.yml \
  -o ~/workspace/cf-deployment/operations/enable-service-discovery.yml \
  --vars-store path/to/vars-store.yml
  # The --var-store flag will cause cli variable generation, and
  # your secrets will be stored in the supplied file path. This is probably not what you
  # want. Read more here: https://bosh.io/docs/cli-int.html#vars-store
```

## Logging

### Debugging problems

* To change logging for service-discovery-controller, ssh onto the VM holding
  the service-discovery-controller and make a request to the log-level server:

```bash
curl -X POST -d 'debug' localhost:8055/log-level
```

where `8055` is the default value of `log_level_port`.

To switch back to `info` logging:

```bash
curl -X POST -d 'info' localhost:8055/log-level
```

* To change logging for bosh-dns-adapter, ssh onto the VM holding the bosh-dns-adapter and make a request to the log-level server:

```bash
curl -X POST -d 'debug' localhost:8066/log-level
```

To switch back to `info` logging:

```bash
curl -X POST -d 'info' localhost:8066/log-level
```

## Tests

Please refer to the [contributing
guide](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-networking-release/blob/develop/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)
for information on running unit and integration tests.  Service-Discovery
specific instructions for running Acceptance and Smoke tests below.

### Running Acceptance Tests

Acceptance tests should be run to see that service discovery is still functional
at a CF level.

#### Running the full acceptance test on bosh-lite

```bash
./scripts/test-sd-acceptance-local
```

#### Running the full acceptance test on specific env

You must set the environment variable `$CONFIG` which points to a JSON file that
contains several pieces of data that will be used to configure the acceptance
tests, e.g. telling the tests how to target your running Cloud Foundry
deployment and what tests to run.

The following can be pasted into a terminal and will set up a sufficient
`$CONFIG` to run the core test suites against a
[BOSH-Lite](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-lite) deployment of CF.
`admin-password` and `admin-secret` need to be replaced with proper values.

```bash
cat > integration_config.json <<EOF
{
  "api": "api.bosh-lite.com",
  "admin_user": "admin",
  "admin_password": "{{admin-password}}",
  "admin_secret": "{{admin-secret}}",
  "apps_domain": "bosh-lite.com",
  "skip_ssl_validation": true,
}
EOF
export CONFIG=$PWD/integration_config.json
```

#### The full set of config parameters is explained below:
##### Required parameters:
Param | Description
------| -----------
`api` | Cloud Controller API endpoint.
`admin_user` | Name of a user in your CF instance with admin credentials.  This admin user must have the `network.admin` scope.
`admin_password` | Password of the admin user above.
`admin_secret` | Secret of the admin user above.
`apps_domain` |  A shared domain that tests can use to create subdomains that will route to applications also created in the tests.
`skip_ssl_validation` |  Set to true if using an invalid (e.g. self-signed) cert for traffic routes to your CF instances; this is generally always true for BOSH-Lite deployments of CF.

Once the config is set, to run the acceptance tests do the following

```bash
ginkgo -r ./src/code.cloudfoundry.org/test/acceptance-sd
```

### Running Smoke Tests
Smoke tests can be run periodically against live environments to check that
basic service discovery remains functional.

Point the environment variable `$CONFIG` to a JSON file with smoke test params.

The following can be pasted into a terminal and will set up a sufficient
`$CONFIG` to run the core test suites against a
[BOSH-Lite](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-lite) deployment of CF.

```bash
cat > integration_config.json <<EOF
{
  "api": "api.bosh-lite.com",
  "apps_domain": "bosh-lite.com",
  "admin_user": "admin",
  "admin_password": "admin",
  "prefix": "smoke-test-",
  "smoke_org": "smoke_org",
  "smoke_space": "smoke_space"
}
EOF
export CONFIG=$PWD/integration_config.json
```

#### The full set of config parameters is explained below:

Parameter | Description | Required?
----------|-------------|----------
`api` |  Cloud Controller API endpoint. | YES
`admin_user` | Name of a user in the CF instance with admin credentials. This admin user must have the `network.admin` scope. | YES
`admin_password` | Password of the admin user above. | YES
`prefix` | Prefix for apps, orgs, and spaces created as part of the smoke tests | YES
`smoke_org` |  Name of pre-existing org for smoke test | NO
`smoke_space`| Name of pre-existing space for smoke test | NO

Once the config is set, run the smoke tests:
```bash
ginkgo -r ./src/code.cloudfoundry.org/test/smoke-sd
```
:

## Configuring

### Configuring Custom Internal Domains

Creating your own internal domain requires [enable-service-discovery
opsfile](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-deployment/blob/master/operations/enable-service-discovery.yml)
and the following two operations:
1. Add the custom internal domain name(s) to the `internal_domains` property on
   the `bosh-dns-adapter` job.

```yaml
- type: replace
  path: /instance_groups/name=diego-cell/jobs/name=bosh-dns-adapter/properties/internal_domains?
  value: ["apps.internal."]
```

> NOTE: The internal domain property in bosh-dns-adapter supports domains with
> and without the trailing dot.

2. Run the following command after deployment:

```bash
cf create-shared-domain <DOMAIN> --internal
```

Or, add the custom internal domain to the `apps_domains` property on
`cloud_controller_ng` job.

```yaml
- type: replace
  path: /instance_groups/name=api/jobs/name=cloud_controller_ng/properties/app_domains/-
  value:
    name: apps.internal
    internal: true
```

NOTE: The internal domain property in cloud_controller_ng does not accept
domains with a trailing dot.

3. Deploy.

To delete a shared domain, run one of the following commands:

```bash
cf curl -X DELETE /v2/shared_domains/<SHARED DOMAIN GUID>
```

```bash
cf delete-shared-domain <DOMAIN> [-f]
```
