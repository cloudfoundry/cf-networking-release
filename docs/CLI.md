# CLI
Network policies can be managed using the [CF CLI](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli), using version `6.30.0` or higher. The [CLI networking plugin](https://plugins.cloudfoundry.org/) is deprecated. Policies are currently configured between applications.
Any tasks that are created will receive the same policies that the app it is associated with has.
